# No More .docx


Has this situation ever happened to you? 

You're curious when an assignment is due or when office hours is, so you go to check out the syllabus, only to find out that the document was uploaded as a .docx file, causing inconvenience, frustration, and embarassment as you wait for Microsoft Word to open up. This has happened to me many times and yes, the best solution is to just go into Word ahead of time and go through the GUI.., but why is there not a faster way?


So, to save a total of 5 seconds per class, I cobbled together this quick Python function in 5 minutes.
